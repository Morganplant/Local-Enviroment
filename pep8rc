# Ignoring various rules:
# - E402 module level import not at top of file
# - E124 closing bracket does not match visual indentation (conflicts with recent pylint, and looks wrong)
# - E126 continuation line over-indented for hanging indent (since pylint also does this and is better at handling
#        exceptions)
# - E241 multiple spaces after ',' (since pylint also does this and is better at handling exceptions)
# - E266 too many leading '#' for block comment
# - W503 line break before binary operator (since W504 line break after binary operator is now the recommended approach)
# - E722 do not use bare 'except' (since pylint does this better)
